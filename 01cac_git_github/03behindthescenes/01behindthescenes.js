    *** Commit behind the scene ***
        Each commit has unique ID

    *** Git behind the scenes ***
        Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files and folders. 
        It is a powerful tool that can help you manage your code more effectively. 
        In this section, we will explore the basics of how git works internally.

    *** Git Snapshots ***
        A git snapshot is a point in time in the history of your code. 
        It represents a specific version of your code, including all the files and folders 
        that were present at that time. Each snapshot is identified by a unique hash code, 
        which is a string of characters that represents the contents of the snapshot.

        A snapshot is not an image, it’s just a representation of the code at a specific point in time. 
        Snapshot is a loose term that is used when git stores information about the code in a locally 
        stored key-value based database. Everything is stored as an object and each object is identified 
        by a unique hash code.

    *** 3 Musketeers of Git ***
        The three musketeers of git are:
            Commit Object
            Tree Object
            Blob Object

        Commit object contains tree object, and inside tree object is blob object: Refer -> musketeersofgit.png

    *** Commit Object ***
        Each commit in the project is stored in .git folder in the form of a commit object. 
        A commit object contains the following information:

            Tree Object
            Parent Commit Object
            Author
            Committer
            Commit Message

    *** Tree Object ***
        Tree Object is a container for all the files and folders in the project. 
        It contains the following information:

            File Mode
            File Name
            File Hash
            Parent Tree Object

        Everything is stored as key-value pairs in the tree object. 
        The key is the file name and the value is the file hash.

    *** Blob Object ***
        Blob Object is present in the tree object and contains the actual file content. 
        This is the place where the file content is stored.

    *** Helpful commands ***
        Here are some helpful commands that you can use to explore the git internals:

            git show -s --pretty=raw <commit-hash>

        Grab tree id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the tree object:

            git ls-tree <tree-id>

        Grab tree id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the blob object:

            git show <blob-id>

        Grab tree id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the commit object:

            git cat-file -p <commit-id>

    VVI but not important for the interview point of view
    Note: git add . and git commit : altogether works and simplifies the internal working of the git
